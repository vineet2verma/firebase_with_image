Smartphones are Necessary for Work
With calendars and contact lists featured on even the most basic models, smartphones have become veritable Swiss Army knives for the modern world.

If used effectively, they can streamline projects and improve employee efficiency. Often they are central to a business’s communication with customers, as well as employees, with many businesses utilizing social media and other downloadable apps.

Using a Personal Phone is a Potential Hazard
However, the use of smartphones for work also has the potential to cause companies serious damage.

One way this can happen is when employees download apps that don’t offer security, which can lead to the leakage of important company and customer information.

Unverified or unrecognized apps should therefore be used with extreme caution – especially free ones, as their revenue often depends on advertising and information gathering.

While bigger apps will screen for viruses and malware threats, they can’t vet the ad links that are bundled with them. In other words, an ad might take an unsuspecting employee to a malicious site, allowing viruses to rapidly infiltrate a company’s entire network.

Companies Must Protect Themselves
The risk of viruses and malware escalates as an increasing number of employees begin to use their personal devices at work for accessing their email and other professional accounts.

But how can companies ensure all their employees are exercising due diligence in this regard?

One way is for businesses to enact a privacy policy.

While this may sound daunting, we’ve made it very simple. Below you’ll find a free privacy policy template that can be downloaded and distributed throughout the company.

It may not guarantee that everyone in the workplace will be careful about what they download, but it will give them a better idea of how apps have the potential to gather and disseminate important data.
